# Linear-Regression-Analysis-of-Economic-Factors-Across-Countries-using-R-Studio
This assignment explores the concept of linear regression analysis and how it can be used to model the relationship between economic factors across multiple countries. Specifically, we examine the relationships between a country's unemployment rate, inflation rate, per capita GDP, and average citizen income.

Using R Studio, we import a dataset containing the relevant economic data for several countries. We then use the lm() function to fit a linear regression model to the data, which allows us to explore the relationships between the different economic factors.

We begin by examining the distribution of the data and checking for any outliers or missing values that may affect our analysis. We then create scatterplots and correlation matrices to visualize the relationships between the different variables.

Overall, this assignment provides an opportunity to gain familiarity with R Studio and the concept of linear regression analysis. By examining the relationships between different economic factors across multiple countries, we can gain valuable insights into the factors that drive economic growth and development.
